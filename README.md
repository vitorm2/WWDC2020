# HelloWorld2

HelloWorld2 is a game developed for Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2020 using **SpriteKit** and **Swift Playgrounds**. In the game, the main character is inside Xcode and has to face dangerous enemies in order to reach submission to the App Store.

Enemies like the fearsome **Storyboard** or the dangerous **ViewController** are prepared to attack using their strongest weapons like the **SearchBar Kamehameha** or an **asset not found meteor**. The only way to beat enemies is throwing **emulators** and **build succeeds**. All this to the sound of **Can’t Get Over** by the band Kasino.
