# HelloWorld2

```HelloWorld2 is a game developed for Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2020 using SpriteKit and Swift Playgrounds. In the game, the main character is inside Xcode and has to face dangerous enemies in order to reach submission to the App Store.```

```Enemies like the fearsome Storyboard or the dangerous ViewController are prepared to attack using their strongest weapons like the SearchBar Kamehameha or a meteor of an asset not found. The only way to beat enemies is to launch emulators and build succeeds. All this to the sound of Can’t Get Over by the band Kasino. aee Kasinãooo```
